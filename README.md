# Why this project

this repo is a personal exercise to learn react

## But what is this ? Merguez Broccoli ?

Allows you to draw lots between different elements (
ex: who will do the dishes?
-> Tom | Bob | both
What are we eating tonight?
-> The laziness, we order a pizza | pasta | ratatouille | merguez and broccoli

Adding a cheat option allowing you to automatically exclude a result, yes yes Bob, I see you coming for not doing the dishes...

Added 2 themes, yes it's useless but I wanted to put into practice so you can choose your theme between ~~dark or light~~ Merguez or broccoli of course

### TODO list

- Add confimation when you cheat
- Switch to typeScript
- see to load the modal outside the Root tag for accessibility (without using react-modal)
- Add a page on the side to play with the routing

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
